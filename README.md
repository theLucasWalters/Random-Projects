# Random Projects
This repository is a collection of programs I just wanted to build.

A lot of them will probably be unfinished (marked with `unfinished`),
but I'll try to keep working on them when I'm not busy.

# Details
All of these projects are built to be executed in a command line.
Some use `if __name__ == "__main__"` notation, but not all do yet.

## Specific Projects

### Calculator (unfinished)
My flawed attempt a creating a CLI calculator. It doesn't really work at the moment, but I'll probably figure it out eventually.

### Scientific Notation (unfinished)
The file isn't marked as unfinished, but it's far from being complete.
It works with small numbers (i.e. `123` or `0.123` convert just fine), but breaks with bigger numbers (`345,600,000` doesn't work).

### Sort Characters
This is a simpler version of the algorithm in `sort-algo`.
It works by parsing the input and sorting each character into one of 5 categories: `vowels`, `consonants`, `integers`, `others`, and `spaces`.

### Sorting Algorithm (unfinished)
This is one of my favorites.
I want to implement a version of a Quicksort algorithm to sort words alphebetically and spit them out.
I have a rough version at the moment, but it's not quite done yet.
